This small module is intended to solve a well-known problem with
sending emails for multiple recipients to one mailbox and then
extracting by remote POP3/IMAP client. Unlike analogs, its main
method is to reinject message for the target mailbox; this is some
more expensive but stable for all setups.

Its proper usage required external lookup domain->mailbox which
should be done using MTA (sendmail, etc.) facilities.

The code wasn't changed since 2003. In 2008 I've left LuckyNet and
missed further support for it, so it's kept mainly for historic
and reference reasons.
