(Currently this is more historic but could be used in some mail
systems...)

This small module is intended to solve a well-known problem with
sending emails for multiple recipients to one mailbox and then
extracting by remote POP3/IMAP client. Unlike analogs, its main
method is to reinject message for the target mailbox; this is some
more expensive but stable for all setups.

Its proper usage required external lookup domain->mailbox which
should be done using MTA (sendmail, etc.) facilities.
